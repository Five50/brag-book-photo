# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an advanced photo editing application built with Next.js. The application is a HIPAA-compliant, browser-based photo editor that operates entirely locally, providing professional-grade editing capabilities including layers, brushes, censoring, adjustments, and image manipulation. The editor combines Photoshop-like functionality with privacy-focused censoring tools and comprehensive audit logging for healthcare compliance, all processed client-side without any server dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import and load images locally into the editor, so that I can edit photos without uploading them to any server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags and drops an image file THEN the system SHALL load it as the base layer
2. WHEN a user clicks the file picker THEN the system SHALL allow selection of JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, or BMP files
3. WHEN an image is loaded THEN the system SHALL create it as a locked base layer at the bottom of the layer stack
4. WHEN a file exceeds 50MB THEN the system SHALL reject the upload and display a memory warning
5. IF an unsupported file type is selected THEN the system SHALL reject the file and display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN an image loads THEN the system SHALL automatically fit it to the canvas viewport

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to work with a Photoshop-like layer system, so that I can perform non-destructive editing with full control over my composition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is loaded THEN the system SHALL create a base image layer that cannot be reordered above other layers
2. WHEN a user adds a new layer THEN the system SHALL create it above the currently selected layer
3. WHEN a user drags a layer in the layers panel THEN the system SHALL reorder layers except the base image layer
4. WHEN a user toggles layer visibility THEN the system SHALL show/hide the layer with an eye icon
5. WHEN a user adjusts layer opacity THEN the system SHALL update the layer transparency from 0-100%
6. WHEN a user selects a blend mode THEN the system SHALL apply the compositing operation to the layer
7. WHEN a user groups layers THEN the system SHALL create a collapsible folder structure
8. WHEN a user locks a layer THEN the system SHALL prevent editing of that layer's content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want professional brush tools for painting and retouching, so that I can perform detailed photo editing and artistic work.

5. WHEN a user enables pressure sensitivity THEN the system SHALL respond to stylus pressure if available
6. WHEN a user selects the eraser THEN the system SHALL remove pixels from the current layer
7. WHEN a user uses the clone stamp THEN the system SHALL copy pixels from a sampled area
8. WHEN a user applies the healing brush THEN the system SHALL blend sampled pixels with surrounding texture

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive image adjustment tools as non-destructive adjustment layers, so that I can color correct and enhance images professionally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a brightness adjustment THEN the system SHALL create an adjustment layer with -100 to +100 range
2. WHEN a user adds a contrast adjustment THEN the system SHALL create an adjustment layer with -100 to +100 range
3. WHEN a user adds a saturation adjustment THEN the system SHALL create an adjustment layer with -100 to +100 range
4. WHEN a user adds shadows/highlights THEN the system SHALL provide separate controls for shadow and highlight regions
5. WHEN a user adds exposure adjustment THEN the system SHALL provide -3 to +3 stops range
6. WHEN a user adds temperature/tint THEN the system SHALL provide warm/cool and green/magenta controls
7. WHEN a user adds curves adjustment THEN the system SHALL provide RGB and individual channel curve control
8. WHEN a user adds levels adjustment THEN the system SHALL provide input/output level controls with histogram

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want specialized censoring tools for privacy protection, so that I can obscure sensitive information before sharing images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a censor shape tool THEN the system SHALL provide rectangle, circle, ellipse, and triangle options
2. WHEN a user draws a censor area THEN the system SHALL create a new censor layer
3. WHEN a user applies solid fill censor THEN the system SHALL completely obscure the selected area
4. WHEN a user applies blur censor THEN the system SHALL apply Gaussian blur from 1-50px
5. WHEN a user applies pixelate censor THEN the system SHALL create pixel blocks from 5-100px size
6. WHEN a user uses brush censor THEN the system SHALL allow freeform painting of censored areas
7. WHEN multiple censor areas exist THEN the system SHALL manage each as a separate layer

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want precise selection and transformation tools, so that I can isolate and modify specific parts of my images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects the rectangular marquee THEN the system SHALL create precise rectangular selections
2. WHEN a user selects the elliptical marquee THEN the system SHALL create circular and oval selections
3. WHEN a user uses the lasso tool THEN the system SHALL allow freehand selection drawing
4. WHEN a user uses the magic wand THEN the system SHALL select similar colors based on tolerance
5. WHEN a user transforms a layer THEN the system SHALL show resize handles only for the selected layer
6. WHEN a user crops the image THEN the system SHALL provide preset ratios (1:1, 4:3, 16:9, etc.)
7. WHEN a user rotates a layer THEN the system SHALL apply rotation only to the selected layer
8. WHEN a user maintains aspect ratio THEN the system SHALL constrain proportions during resize

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I need comprehensive audit logging for HIPAA compliance, so that all image editing activities are tracked and reportable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads an image THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp and file metadata
2. WHEN a user performs any edit action THEN the system SHALL record the action type, parameters, and timestamp
